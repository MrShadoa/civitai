As a platform, our ultimate goal is to foster an environment of openness and inclusivity, empowering our users by giving them control over their viewing experiences. We aim to strike a balance between user freedom and the necessary boundaries to maintain a safe and respectful community.

## Our Vision

Our commitment to openness and inclusivity stems from three key beliefs:
1. Content pushed into the shadows can grow in unmanageable ways. Transparency helps us navigate the development of AI content effectively.
2. AI has the potential for a multitude of creative applications, and we aim to support this diversity.
3. Diverse ideas and perspectives from different cultural, social, and creative backgrounds enrich our community, and we strive to give them a platform to thrive.

## User Control

We prioritize user control and offer detailed options for customizing content visibility. This includes:

1. **Control Over Content Types:** Users can decide the types of moderated content they wish to view, such as enabling nudity but not explicit nudity.
2. **Tag-Based Filtering:** Users can hide specific content based on tags. For instance, if a user doesn't want to view anime content, they can hide the anime tag.
3. **Selective Hiding:** Users can choose to hide specific images, models, or even entire users.

## How We Support User Control

We facilitate this high degree of user control through a combination of automated systems and community involvement:

1. **Automated Content Labeling:** We use Amazon Rekognition to automatically apply content labels and screen images for moderated content.
2. **Community-Driven Moderation:** Users can vote on the content labels applied to images, helping us refine our image classification system. We encourage users to report content violations and reward their efforts through a Guardian's leaderboard that highlights the most helpful community members.
3. **Manual Reviews:** Certain combinations of tags or resources trigger a manual review before the content becomes publicly visible.

## Challenges and Future Plans

Despite our efforts, we acknowledge the existence of certain challenges:

1. Our automated image tagging system struggles, particularly with Anime content.
2. Although users can manually tag their images with appropriate mature content labels, many rely solely on the automated system.
3. Our moderation team is small, facing the daunting task of reviewing tens of thousands of image uploads daily.

To address these issues, we have planned the following improvements to be implemented over the next several weeks:

1. **Improved Tagging System:** We aim to implement our own image content tagging system to enhance accuracy, especially for complex categories like Anime.
2. **User Participation:** We plan to give new rewards for accurate content reporting and participation in tag clean-up, encouraging more active user involvement.
3. **Team Expansion:** We aim to grow our moderation team to manage the large volume of daily uploads more effectively.

We are committed to continuous improvement and maintaining a user-oriented, inclusive, and safe platform. As part of our community, we encourage you to contribute to these efforts by respecting our rules and participating in content moderation where possible.

## Our Rules

Before contributing to our site, we require users to familiarize themselves with our [content rules](/content/tos). These are particularly stringent when it comes to content involving [real people](/content/rules/real-people) and [minors](/content/rules/minors). Furthermore, to maintain a user-oriented experience, moderated content remains hidden until users register an account and set their personal content visibility preferences.
